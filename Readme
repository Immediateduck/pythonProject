first github project so sorry for any broken traditions.
the main is the file where i test the code.
there are two boxes i use to make the equations
1) Variable
    the variable box always connects to a maximum of 2 boxes.it checks its connected boxes if they have a value
    and then copies the value from them
2) Operator
    the operator box has 2 modes.only the second mode has not been coded as of now.when a new instance of operator box is created the first
    argument passed in the constructor is a boolean.(True denotes that the first mode is selected)
    FIRST MODE-
        the first mode can only perform commutative operations(like +,* etc)
        2 functions must be passed to the constructor op and rop.
            op is the operation which the box performs like addition(argument should be a list)
            rop is the reverse operation of the given operation(like lambda a,b : a-b)
            for the op function must be passed through the wrapper function packageLambda() to create a new function (for my convenience)
            which in turn should be passed instead of the op.(check the creation of plus in main file to understand
use the controller object to connect 2 boxes and voila the code works.
sorry this prolly makes noo sense but i am a high schooler and this is my first github thing
